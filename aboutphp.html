      <h1>About PHP</h1>
      <p>
        What is PHP?
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Originally stood for Personal Home Page now stands for recursive acronym <span style="color:RED">PHP HyperText Preprocessor</span>.</li>
            <li>PHP is a general-purpose or server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development.</li>
            <li>
              created to allow creation of dynamic websites
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </p>

      <h1>History</h1>
      <p> PHP is created by <span style="color:RED;">Rasmus Lerdorf</span> in 1995. He was writing some Common Gateway Interface (CGI) in C which he was using to maintain his personal homepage, where he had posted his resume. He wanted to know the amount of traffic his site was receiving,
        which could not be done by HTML. He extended the CGI to work with web forms and to communicate with databases. He called this implementation <span style="color:RED">"Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter or PHP/FI"</span>.
      </p>

      <h1>PHP and HTML</h1>
      <p>
        <span class="underline">HTML = content</span>- building blocks of web pages. It allows us to put images, text, forms, and so on pieces of content together. It describes to the browser how to display text or other objects in a browser window.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="underline">PHP = functionality</span> - makes website "do stuff".
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus PHP is embedded in HTML to make website dynamic.
